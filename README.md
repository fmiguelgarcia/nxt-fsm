The `nxt-fsm` crate provides a simple and universal framework for building
state machines in Rust with minimum effort.

The essential part of this crate is the
[`StateMachineImpl`](trait.StateMachineImpl.html) trait. This trait allows a
developer to provide a strict state machine definition, e.g. specify its:

- An **input alphabet** - a set of entities that the state machine takes as inputs
  and performs state transitions based on them.
- Possible **states** - a set of states this machine could be in.
- An **output alphabet** - a set of entities that the state machine may output as
  results of its work.
- A **transition function with optional output** - a function that changes the
  state of the state machine based on its current state and the provided
  input, and optional returns an element from the _output alphabet_.
- The **initial state** of the machine.

Note that on the implementation level such abstraction allows build any type of
state machines:

- A classical state machine by providing only an input alphabet, a set of states
  and a transition function.
- A Mealy machine by providing all entities listed above.
- A Moore machine by providing an output function that do not depend on the
  provided inputs.

## Feature flags

### Default

- `std` - implement features that require the `std` environment. See below.
- `dsl` - re-export `nxt-fsm-dsl` from `nxt-fsm`. Recommended to leave this on
  for the best development experience.

### Non-default

- `diagram` - generate Mermaid state diagrams in the doc strings. See below.
- `pretty-print` - format guard expressions in diagrams using idiomatic Rust style
  (requires `diagram` feature). When enabled, guard expressions are formatted with
  `prettyplease` for better readability. Without this feature, a basic sanitization
  is applied to make expressions safe for Mermaid.

## Usage in `no_std` environments

This library has the feature named `std` which is enabled by default. You may
want to import this library as
`nxt-fsm = { version = "0.8", default-features = false, features = ["dsl"] }`
to use it in a `no_std` environment. This only affects error types (the `Error`
trait is only available in `std`).

The DSL implementation re-export is gated by the feature named `dsl` which is
also enabled by default.

## Use

Initially this library was designed to build an easy to use DSL for defining
state machines on top of it. Using the DSL will require to connect an additional
crate `nxt-fsm-dsl` (this is due to limitation of the procedural macros
system).

### Using the DSL for defining state machines

The DSL is parsed by the `state_machine` macro. Here is a little example.

```rust
use rust_fsm::*;

state_machine! {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    #[repr(C)]
    /// A Circuit Breaker state machine.
    circuit_breaker(Closed)

    Closed(Unsuccessful) => Open [SetupTimer],
    Open(TimerTriggered) => HalfOpen,
    HalfOpen => {
        Successful => Closed,
        Unsuccessful => Open [SetupTimer]
    }
}
```

This code sample:

- Defines a state machine called `circuit_breaker`;
- Derives the `Debug` trait for it. All attributes you use here (like
  `#[repr(C)]`) will be **applied to all types generated by this macro**. If you
  want to apply attributes or a docstring to the `mod` generated by this macro,
  just put it before the macro invocation.
- Sets the initial state of this state machine to `Closed`;
- Defines state transitions. For example: on receiving the `Successful` input
  when in the `HalfOpen` state, the machine must move to the `Closed` state;
- Defines outputs. For example: on receiving `Unsuccessful` in the `Closed`
  state, the machine must output `SetupTimer`.

This state machine can be used as follows:

```rust,ignore
// Initialize the state machine. The state is `Closed` now.
let mut machine = circuit_breaker::StateMachine::new();
// Consume the `Successful` input. No state transition is performed.
let _ = machine.consume(&circuit_breaker::Input::Successful);
// Consume the `Unsuccesful` input. The machine is moved to the `Open`
// state. The output is `SetupTimer`.
let output = machine.consume(&circuit_breaker::Input::Unsuccessful).unwrap();
// Check the output
if let Some(circuit_breaker::Output::SetupTimer) = output {
    // Set up the timer...
}
// Check the state
if let circuit_breaker::State::Open = machine.state() {
    // Do something...
}
```

The following entities are generated:

- An empty structure `circuit_breaker::Impl` that implements the
  `StateMachineImpl` trait.
- Enums `circuit_breaker::State`, `circuit_breaker::Input` and
  `circuit_breaker::Output` that represent the state, the input alphabet and the
  output alphabet respectively.
- Type alias `circuit_breaker::StateMachine` that expands to
  `StateMachine<circuit_breaker::Impl>`.

Note that if there is no outputs in the specification, the output alphabet is an
empty enum and due to technical limitations of many Rust attributes, no
attributes (e.g. `derive`, `repr`) are applied to it.

Within the `state_machine` macro you must define at least one state transition.

#### Guards

Guards allow you to **conditionally control state transitions based on input data**.
They are particularly useful when your inputs are **tuple variants** carrying data,
and you want different transitions based on that data.

Guards are defined using:

- the `if` keyword followed by a _closure_ that takes a
  reference to the input data and returns a boolean:

```rust
use rust_fsm::*;

state_machine! {
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
    turnstile(Locked)

    Locked => {
        Coin(u32) if |amount: &u32| *amount >= 50 => Unlocked,
        Coin(u32) if |amount: &u32| *amount < 50 => Locked [RefundInsufficient],
        Push => Locked [AccessDenied]
    },
    Unlocked => {
        Push => Locked,
        Coin(u32) => Unlocked [AlreadyUnlocked]
    }
}

let mut machine = turnstile::StateMachine::new();

// Insufficient coin - stays locked
let res = machine.consume(&turnstile::Input::Coin(25));
assert_eq!(res, Ok(Some(turnstile::Output::RefundInsufficient)));
assert_eq!(machine.state(), &turnstile::State::Locked);

// Sufficient coin - unlocks
let res = machine.consume(&turnstile::Input::Coin(50));
assert_eq!(machine.state(), &turnstile::State::Unlocked);
```

- the `match` keyword followed by

```rust
use rust_fsm::*;

state_machine! {
   #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
   door_lock(Locked)

┃  Locked => {
  ┃   KeyCard(String) match |card: &String| card.as_str() {
         "admin" => Unlocked,
         "guest" => PartialAccess,
         _ => Locked [InvalidCard]
      },
      Pin(u32) match |pin: &u32| *pin {
         1234 => Unlocked,
        _ => Locked [WrongPin]
      }
   },
  PartialAccess(RequestFullAccess) => Locked [AccessDenied]
  Unlocked(Lock) => Locked
}
```

#### Dynamic outputs with closures

In addition to static output variants, you can use closures to compute outputs
dynamically based on input data. This is especially useful when working with
tuple variant inputs that carry data.

Closures are defined in the output section using the syntax `[|param1, param2| expression]`:

```rust,ignore
use rust_fsm::*;

// Define a custom output type
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum CalcOutput {
    Result(i32),
}

state_machine! {
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
    #[state_machine(output(CalcOutput))]
    calculator(Idle)

    use super::CalcOutput;

    Idle => {
        Add(i32, i32) => Idle [|a: &i32, b: &i32| CalcOutput::Result(a + b)],
        Multiply(i32, i32) => Idle [|x: &i32, y: &i32| CalcOutput::Result(x * y)],
        Reset => Idle
    }
}

let mut machine = calculator::StateMachine::new();

// Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
let result = machine.consume(&calculator::Input::Add(5, 3)).unwrap();
assert_eq!(result, Some(CalcOutput::Result(8)));

// Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
let result = machine.consume(&calculator::Input::Multiply(4, 7)).unwrap();
assert_eq!(result, Some(CalcOutput::Result(28)));
```

Note: When using closure-based outputs, you typically need to define a custom
output type (using `#[state_machine(output(...))]`) and import it with a `use`
statement inside the state machine definition.

#### Tuple variant inputs with references

When working with tuple variant inputs that contain references (like `&str` or `&[u8]`),
you can leverage guards to process the referenced data. This is particularly
useful for scenarios where you need to inspect borrowed data without taking
ownership:

```rust
use nxt_fsm::*;

state_machine! {
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
    auth_system(Idle)

    Idle => {
        // Using &str references with if guards
        Authenticate(&str) if |username: &&str| username.len() > 0 => Validating,
        Authenticate(&str) if |username: &&str| username.is_empty() => Idle [EmptyUsername]
    },
    Validating => {
        // Using &[u8] references with match guards
        CheckHash(&[u8]) match |hash: &&[u8]| hash.len() {
            32 => Authenticated,
            _ => Idle [InvalidHash]
        },
        // Pattern matching on string content
        CheckRole(&str) match |role: &&str| *role {
            "admin" => AdminMode,
            "user" => UserMode,
            _ => Idle [UnknownRole]
        }
    },
    Authenticated(Logout) => Idle,
    AdminMode(Logout) => Idle,
    UserMode(Logout) => Idle,
}

let mut machine = auth_system::StateMachine::new();

// Authenticate with non-empty username
let res = machine.consume(&auth_system::Input::Authenticate("alice"));
assert_eq!(machine.state(), &auth_system::State::Validating);

// Check with valid 32-byte hash
let hash: [u8; 32] = [0; 32];
let res = machine.consume(&auth_system::Input::CheckHash(&hash));
assert_eq!(machine.state(), &auth_system::State::Authenticated);

// Reset and try role-based auth
machine.consume(&auth_system::Input::Logout);
machine.consume(&auth_system::Input::Authenticate("bob"));
let res = machine.consume(&auth_system::Input::CheckRole("admin"));
assert_eq!(machine.state(), &auth_system::State::AdminMode);
```

Note that when using guards with reference types:

- The closure parameter has an extra level of
  indirection (e.g., `&&str` instead of `&str`)
- You can dereference once to get the borrowed data (e.g., `*role` to get `&str`)
- This allows you to work with borrowed data efficiently without cloning

#### Visibility

You can specify visibility like this:

```rust
use rust_fsm::*;

state_machine! {
    pub CircuitBreaker(Closed)

    Closed(Unsuccessful) => Open [SetupTimer],
    Open(TimerTriggered) => HalfOpen,
    HalfOpen => {
        Successful => Closed,
        Unsuccessful => Open [SetupTimer],
    }
}
```

The default visibility is private.

#### Custom alphabet types

You can supply your own types to use as input, output or state. All of them are
optional: you can use only one of them or all of them at once if you want to.
The current limitation is that you have to supply a fully qualified type path.

```rust,ignore
use rust_fsm::*;

pub enum Input {
    Successful,
    Unsuccessful,
    TimerTriggered,
}

pub enum State {
    Closed,
    HalfOpen,
    Open,
}

pub enum Output {
    SetupTimer,
}

state_machine! {
    #[state_machine(input(crate::Input), state(crate::State), output(crate::Output))]
    circuit_breaker(Closed)

    Closed(Unsuccessful) => Open [SetupTimer],
    Open(TimerTriggered) => HalfOpen,
    HalfOpen => {
        Successful => Closed,
        Unsuccessful => Open [SetupTimer]
    }
}
```

#### Diagrams

`state_machine` macro can document your state machines with diagrams. This is
controlled by the `diagram` feature, which is non-default. The diagrams are
generated in the [Mermaid][mermaid] format. This feature includes the Mermaid
script into the documentation page.

The diagrams automatically represent:

- **Nested states**: States with multiple self-loop transitions are shown
  as composite states
- **Choice states**: Guard conditions are represented using Mermaid's `<<choice>>`
  notation
- **Guard expressions**: When the `pretty-print` feature is enabled, guard
  expressions are formatted using `prettyplease` for idiomatic Rust style.
  Without this feature, a basic sanitization replaces special characters to
  ensure `Mermaid` compatibility.

To see this in action, download the repository and run:

```bash
cargo doc -p doc-example --open
```

### Without DSL

The `state_machine` macro has limited capabilities (for example, a state cannot
carry any additional data), so in certain complex cases a user might want to
write a more complex state machine by hand.

All you need to do to build a state machine is to implement the
`StateMachineImpl` trait and use it in conjuctions with some of the provided
wrappers (for now there is only `StateMachine`).

You can see an example of the Circuit Breaker state machine in the [project
repository][repo].
